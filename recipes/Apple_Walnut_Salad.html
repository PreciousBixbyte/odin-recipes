        <h2>Oh, Snap! Apple Walnut Salad recipe</h2>

        <p>This memorable, beautiful salad might feel fancy, but it's actually super easy to prepare!</p>
 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Arugula - A member of the Brassica family, arugula is a delicious green with its own unique flavor. It's 
                tender and has a slightly peppery taste that adds wonderful flavor to salads like this one.</li>

            <li>Belgian Endive - While there are a few varieties of endive, you'll want to use Belgian endive specifically 
                for this recipe. It resembles a small head of lettuce with light yellow leaves. Refreshingly crisp and mildly 
                bitter, it is a welcome counterpart to both the apples and arugula.</li>

            <li>Apples - The apples soak up the scrumptious dressing flavor and add a wonderful juicy crunch to the salad. 
                Honeycrisp apples are a great option, just like in Grape Salad.</li>

            <li>Dried Cranberries - With their chewy texture, sweet flavor, and festive color, dried cranberries are an exceptional 
                addition for both elegance and taste.</li>

            <li>Blue Cheese - A classic pairing with apple and walnut, blue cheese is a perfect fit here. For something mild, use 
                gorgonzola; for something stronger, look for Cabrales (a Spanish blue cheese) or Roquefort (which is French). 
                Not into blue cheese? Feta and goat cheese both work well.</li>

            <li>Nuts - Freshly toasted walnuts make all the difference in the world.</li>

            <li>Maple Cinnamon Dressing - A little sweet, a little tangy, and a lot delicious (especially with the apples!). 
                Be sure to add it gradually so that you don't accidentally overdress the salad.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Toast and chop the walnuts.</li>

            <li>Whisk the dressing ingredients together. Stir in the apples.</li>

            <li>Place the arugula and endive in a bowl.</li>

            <li>Add part of the cranberries, cheese, and walnuts.</li>
            
            <li>Transfer the apples to the bowl with the greens. Toss to coat. Continue to add the dressing until 
                the salad is moist.</li>
                
            <li>Finish with the remaining toppings and toss. ENJOY!</li>
        </ol>
